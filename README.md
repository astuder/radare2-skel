# Radare2 Script Skeletons

This repository contains directories that can be used as an skeleton or template
to start writing your projects that use radare2.

Radare2 can be extended in many ways:

* Scripts
* Plugins
* Programs

And it is possible to use almost any languages to do so. Those templates include
the `.vscode` and build files too. so you can quickly start doing real work!
